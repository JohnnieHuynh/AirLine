#AirLine

#Description
My first Android application! AirLine allows users to shop around for flights.
Users must create an account to enter the system or use of the pre-existing
accounts.  From the menu, users are able to reserve, cancel or edit flights.

#Project Status
The "initial" project (the repos first commit) is 60% - 70% functioning.
The apps sections that are functional: account management and displaying data
are very sensitive.  The data has to be entered in very accurately.  Deleting and editing
flights are needs work as it doesn't function correctly 100% of the time.  The project has
been stopped working on.  I plan to eventually push a complete edition to finish my first app.
